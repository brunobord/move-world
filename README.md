# Moves

> When you move, roll the appropriate move.

This [Powered by the Apocalypse](http://apocalypse-world.com/) tabletop role-playing game is an experiment around the concept of *Moves*, that are central in *Apocalypse World*. Moves here are taken literaly, and are only triggered by the movements of the body of the character.

## Characters

Each character has 3 stats:

* ``feet``: run, dance, balance, acrobatics, kick,
* ``arms``: lift, punch, crush, slice, throw,
* ``fingers``: steal, pickpocket, fix, type, paint, play music,

Each player will chose one of the playbooks below, assign the scores as defined in the playbook. Then the player will pick an option and a special ability.

This character must have a name, and the player will describe the character's background and general appearance.

If the MC feels the need, she may ask the players to explain how the characters know each other.

### Playbooks

* [The jog](playbooks/the-jog.md)
* [The lifter](playbooks/the-lifter.md)
* [The nimble](playbooks/the-nimble.md)
* [The clumsy](playbooks/the-clumsy.md)

## Play the game

The MC will present situations and eventually the players will have to make a movement with their body. Each time a body movement is uncertain, presents a risk, or even danger, the MC will have to call for a **Move**.

**When you move** ``roll 2d6+stat``:

* on 6-: something bad is happening. The MC may call for a *hard move*.
* on 7-9: you barely succeed, but with a cost. The MC may call for a *soft move*.
* on 10+: you succeed.

### Examples of MC moves

* Your movement is stopped,
* Your movement is slower than expected,
* You're being noticed by someone else,
* You fall,
* You drop the item,
* The device stops working,
* You're hurt, stunned, injured,
* Something's is happening in the background,
* You're threatened,
* The other doesn't fall into your trap,
* The other starts to dislike what you do,
* You mistype on your keyboard and hit [Enter],

### The Body Clock

Each character starts with a Body Clock that has a number of segments. It represents the stamina of the character. When all the segments are blank, the character is in the best health possible.

When the character is hurt, the MC tells the player how many segments he has to strike or fill.

When the character has only 2 segments left, **every Move** has a -1 modifier.

When the character strikes off his last segment, he falls unconcious. If he's not healed quickly, the character dies.

#### Healing

If only one or two segments are filled, the character can regain them with a full rest (on full night of sleep).

For every other segment, it'll be restored at the price of one per week *to the condition that the character does nothing else than rest and respects the treatment*.
