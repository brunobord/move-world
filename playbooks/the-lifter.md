## Options

Pick one:

- [ ] *brawl*: add +1 to any fist fight phase.
- [ ] *weapon*: add +1 when you use a heavy object to hit things.
- [ ] *lift*: add +1 if you have to lift a heavy object.
- [ ] *throw*: add +1 to throw an object with precision.
- [ ] *impress*: add +1 when your physical appearance can keep others silent or respectful.

### Special ability

Pick one:

- [ ] *Gang*: a small group of individuals will help you when you're in trouble for a fight (once per session).
- [ ] *Berserk*: you can ignore your pain, and continue to hit everyone at full power for a few minutes before falling unconcious (once per session).
