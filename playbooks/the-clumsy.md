# The clumsy

> Don't touch anything, don't go anywhere, don't do anything or things will be broken.

*The clumsy* is a very special playbook. Instead of having at least one domain in which he has talent, he's bad at everything.

Assign -2 to one of the stats, and -1 to the others.

## Options

Pick one:

- [ ] *fall*: add -1 each time you have to run.
- [ ] *drop*: add -1 each time you carry something.
- [ ] *break*: add -1 each time you touch something fragile or that can break (mechanics or electronics).

## Special ability

Pick one:

- [ ] *Lucky*: despite your clumsiness, you can ask for reroll once per session.
- [ ] *Convincing*: people trust you ; you can convince somebody of something unbelievable once per session.

## Clock

The clumsy body clock has eight segments.
